            Welcome back. Choose a course to start exploring computer science ideas with puzzles,
            mini games, and short lessons. Each card shows how many lessons are in that course and
            how far along you are.

        <strong>Hint for your study tasks:</strong>
        Try expanding the Algorithms and Abstraction cards. You can count lessons,
        find the title of the second Algorithms section, see how many sections are in Abstraction,
        list data structures, find divide and conquer algorithms, and read the definition
        of a Binary Search Tree directly from this dashboard.
